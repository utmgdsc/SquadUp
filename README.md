Running SquadUp!:
As of now, the only way to run the SquadUp! app is through the Expo Go app, so that must be installed first.

Steps:
1. Git clone the repo into a folder
2. Type and run 'npm-install' into the terminal while in the SquadUp folder
3. Type and run 'expo start' in the same location
4. Scan the QR code using your mobile device
5. Code will redirect you to the app on Expo Go
